# Minimal Neovim configuration

These are the plugins and settings I can't live without and will setup as soon as I install neovim / setup a new work environment.

# Features

- Plugin management with [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- Directory and file navigation and management with [Oil](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim)
- Fuzzy file search and live grep with [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)

# Prerequisites

This configuration is intended to require the least amount of installation possible.  However, there are some extremely useful tools you should install anyway:

- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
